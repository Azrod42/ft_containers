# ft_containers WIP

Welcome to the ft_containers project. In this project, we dive deep into the world of C++ data structures and re imagine some of the fundamental containers found in the C++ Standard Library (STL).

The primary objective of this project is to provide with a comprehensive understanding of how containers work by having them implement these containers from scratch. This involves creating essential data structures such as linked vectors, stacks, and map using only the fundamental features of the C++ language

### Key feature
- Implementation of various container types.
- In-depth exploration of memory management and data manipulation.
- Performance optimization of data structures.
